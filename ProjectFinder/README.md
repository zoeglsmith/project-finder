# Project Finder Application
 
 ## Project Finder Blurb:
There is a missed opportunity for both students and staff at the university due to a lack of visibility for available research projects. Students who are interested in participating in research projects may not be aware of available opportunities, while staff may miss out on hiring qualified students for their projects. We believe that this bottleneck in our academic scene needs to be addressed. To solve this issue, we are interested in developing a web application that can list current research projects from our staff, including their characteristics such as the principal investigator, field of knowledge, abstract, required skills, and available scholarships. The app should also be searchable for students to easily find projects that match their interests and qualifications. Could you develop such a web-app?

## Functionalities:
- Somewhere for staff and students to post and search for projects
- Filtering for the projects through interests, qualifications
- Student account and staff accounts - staff has projects associated and students have interests/qualifications
- Student account shows qualifications that they have and what they're looking for
- Staff put in the projects interests that they're looking for
- Students put in their interests and staff can see this for their projects
- Projects need to be able to show characteristics such as principal investigator, field of knowledge, abstract etc.
- Search function
- Save / bookmark / applications


## Front-end
- HTML/CSS: Helps with the visual and user interface part of our software e.g How the web page looks
- JavaScript: Helps with the functionality of the user interface e.g Clicking on a button causes x event
## Back-end:
- MongoDBS: Helps store our data and any data entered by a user e.g user creates an account
- H2: Helps store our data and any data entered by a user

## Technologies:
- VScode: more extensions, easier to use same OSS, helpful tools to debug
- What frameworks?
- Bootstrap
- React
- Express
- Git: Helps with merge conflicts, issue and commits etc

## Deployment???
- Heroku
